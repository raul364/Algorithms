CENCESHEKNEWNOTWHATWASEXPECTED

I used decryptTransposition function from the python file which prints the cipher text written column wise into each column based on length of cipher diveded by the number of columns.
This prints out the cipher text in 6 columns which i extracted and manually analysed to find the order (250413). I then edited (commented out if statements) decryptTransposition to print the columns out in "2,5,0,4,1,3" order
which converted the cipher into plain text.
