To decrypt this i parsed the string of tess27.txt and the cipher into letterFreq function in the provided python file, which gave me the frequency of all letters and characters in the alphabet
using that i deduced that 'V' and 'A' in the cipher were most likely '|' and 'E' in the language. I then parsed the cipher and the mapping {V: ' ', A: E} into decrpytEx7 function which broke the cipher into words.
Knowing that 'E' was in the correct position, I then looked for any 3 letter words which had E in it. I stummbeled up on 'OEX EYEP' (OAX AYAP - orginal cipher) and decided EYEP was most likely EYES
and so i updated the mapping list and ran decryptEx7 again. I kept manual going over the updated cipher and comparing with the original cipher to spot new words.
The Mapping at the end:
(letters in cipher: mapped to)
{'A': 'E', 
 'B': 'F',
 'E': 'P',
 'F': 'B',
 'G': 'G',
 'H': 'V',
 'I': 'M',
 'J': 'A',
 'K': 'N', 
 'M': 'U',
 'N': 'I',
 'O': 'H',
 'P': 'S',
 'Q': 'L',
 'R': 'O',
 'S': 'D',
 'T': 'C',
 'V': '|',
 'X': 'R',
 'Y': 'Y',
 'Z': 'W',
 '|': 'T'}
